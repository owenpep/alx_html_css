# Headphones Landing Page

This project is a fully responsive, accessible web page built using only HTML and CSS â€” no external libraries or JavaScript.

It is a pixel-perfect recreation of a Figma design created by Nicolas Philippot, demonstrating best practices in semantic HTML, responsive design, and CSS styling.

## Project Requirements

- No use of external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap)
- No use of JavaScript
- Built with pure HTML and CSS
- Must be responsive at screen widths of 480px or less
- All layout and style must match the original Figma design
- Accessibility and semantic structure must be implemented
- Max content width is 1000px, centered

## Design Reference

To inspect and build accurately:
1. Create a Figma account
2. Duplicate the design file to your drafts
3. Download and install required fonts:
   - Source Sans Pro
   - Spin-Cycle-OT

If fonts are not available on your system, fallbacks are used in the CSS.
